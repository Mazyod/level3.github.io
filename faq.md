# What information do you collect about me?

Level3 does not collect any *private data* about you, so please rest assured that in the unlikely event of a data breach, there is nothing to be gained by the offending party.

However, in order to authorize access to your account, **including your in-app purchases**, we request that you authenticate in order to access your account. This means, we store your ID. The ID could be your email, facebook ID, twitter ID, or other information depending on your choice of login.

We also store your **public** information in order to enhance your experience, such as recommend a username for you upon creating your account.

Finally, we do collect anonymous information, such as masked crash logs and usage statistics, in order to measure overall user experience and satisfaction.

# What if I wanted to delete my account, and all associated data?

Simply send an email to [support@level3.io](mailto:support@level3.io?subject=Account%20Deletion) with the subject: "Account Deletion". You will recieve a response within 48 hours to verify your information and confirm the deletion process. In order to verify your information, you will need to be able to access the same login method used for your account. For example, if your account is associated with Twitter login, you will need access to the same twitter account in order to confirm your identity.

**IMPORTANT:** IN DOING SO, YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS IN THE GAME, INCLUDING ANY IN APP PURCHASES OR COLLECTED DIGITAL ASSETS. ONCE THE OPERATION IS CONFIRMED, IT CANNOT BE REVERSED.
