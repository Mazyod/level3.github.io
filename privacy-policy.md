### Introduction and Your Agreement to this Privacy Policy

Level3 Games, and its affiliates (“Level3 Games”, “us”, “our” or “we”) are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users (“users” or “you”). This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect in connection with our website at level3.io (the “Site”) and its subdomains or any of our applications provided on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the “Service”). Personal information can include, for example, an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information collected or received by Level3 Games through your use of the Service. Level3 Games is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.

BY INSTALLING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICE. We may update this Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Policy. We will post all changes to this Policy on this page and the modified policy will specify its effective date.

### Information Collected and Used

Our primary objective in collecting your information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable you to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. For example, we may use your information to register your account, provide customer support, resolve disputes, collect fees, connect users, and notify you of updates to the game (or of other/new games) and special promotions.

### iOS or Android Platforms

When you use any of our games or applications, we automatically collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, hardware type, the version of your operating system (“OS”), your in-game activity, and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address).

This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends.

We use country information to customize the user experience and promotions, enforce our terms of service, and make recommendations about user connections.

### Platforms/Third-Party Marketplaces

In the course of providing our Service on third party platforms/marketplaces, such as Apple’s App Store, the platforms/marketplaces may collect information about you or receive information from us in order for the platforms/marketplaces to provide or analyze their services. Please note that these platforms/marketplaces were developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by us and that we are not responsible for the actions of those people or companies. You should carefully review the terms of service and privacy policies of the platforms/third-party marketplaces that you use to access our Service.

### Facebook Connect

If you sign into the Service with Facebook Connect we will collect basic information such as: (1) your first and last name, (2) Facebook ID, (3) Profile Picture/URL, (4) Email, and (5) list of Facebook friends. Your name will be primarily used for user registration and in social features, which may include friend-to-friend interaction, chat or messaging functionality, public leaderboards, head-to-head competition and other similar features. Your email would be used to help you recover your account, or otherwise reach out to you with your consent. We will never use the email for sending unsolicited email nor share it with any third party.

### In-Game Prompts

When you register to play our games through the Service, we may ask whether you’d like to provide us with certain pieces of information, which could include: your email, username, and phone number. We will do this through in-game prompts, which you may choose to skip. If you provide your email address in connection with our game, the email address will be retained by us. Your email will never be shared with a third party, and will only be used to contact you with your consent, for example to help recover your account or if you explicitly opt-in to our newsletter. Your username may be used for social features in our games (e.g., presenting someone’s name on a message board). Your phone number may be used to help connect you with other users via our social networking system and for SMS notifications.

### Email Newsletter

You may elect to sign up for our email newsletter, which will contain information and advertisements about our products. You can opt-out at anytime, as well, though it might take up to 5 business days to process your request.

### Website

When you visit our Site, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses may be logged automatically. We may also collect information about your usage and activity, such as number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. We may use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Information

Level3 Games does not share your personal information except as approved by you or as described below:

We may release your information as permitted by law or when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our rights; or protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

Level3 Games may share your information in connection with any merger, sale of our assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

We may anonymize and aggregate information about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

### Third Party Tools/Analytics

The Service may also contain third party tracking tools from third party service providers, which may enable these third parties to analyze our users’ information. While these third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for us, they will not be permitted to use such information for any purpose other than providing their services.

### Offer Walls and Other Advertisements

You may see our games advertised in other applications. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of the Service. In order to prevent fraud and verify the installs, a unique device identifier may be shared with the advertiser.

### Changing or Deleting Your Information

You may contact us regarding any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy by emailing us at [support@level3.io][mailto-support]. If you completely delete all of your information, your account may become deactivated. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt-out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts.

### Security

Level3 Games has put in place industry standard technical and organizational measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information through these mediums.

### International Transfer

We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Policy.
